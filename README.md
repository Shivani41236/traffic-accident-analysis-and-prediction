# traffic-accident-analysis-and-prediction
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting traffic accidents using historical data and machine learning models. It helps uncover trends, identify accident-prone conditions, and forecast future accident risks. The goal is to support better traffic management and enhance road safety through data-driven insights.

## Objective
- To study historical traffic accident data and extract meaningful patterns.
- To identify major factors contributing to accidents, such as time, location, weather, and road conditions.
- To develop predictive models that can estimate the likelihood or severity of accidents.
- To provide visualizations and predictions that aid decision-makers in reducing road accidents.
